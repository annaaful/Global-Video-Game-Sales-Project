# Global Video Game Sales 

Video games have served as one of the most popular forms of entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds over the last few decades. As the industry grows and its target audience increases in diversity, it would be advantageous to examine trends in video game popularity across different regions. This information can be used to help stakeholders make data driven business decisions such as when attempting to maximize revenue or target a specific type of audience. Global sales will be compared to those of North America, Europe, and Japan. 

## Description

Several datasets were merged to include information on different features and region sales of a large quantity of various video games over the years. These features included genre, publisher, platform the game, was offered on and year of release. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations revealed many interesting trends.

I constructed four multiple linear regression models to predict sales across the different regions:

1. North America
2. Europe
3. Japan
4. All other regions
